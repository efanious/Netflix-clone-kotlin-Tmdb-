### Movie Guide App 

<hr />

This is an app which shows info about movies, old and new and helps track your favourite movies. It is basically just to show case my native android skills 
in Kotlin and a reference project. You can create PR's if you see something you want to improve on.

It is still ongoing as I will keep updating it to make the code better and add new features as well.

### UI flows
